I've been looking to make a transition and have heard some people who had an amazing experience here. I signed up for the free intro course and found it incredibly fun! I enrolled shortly thereafter. The next 12 weeks was the best - and most grueling - time of my life. Since completing the course, I've successfully switched careers, working as a Software Engineer at a VR startup. "</p>

        <p class="opacity-70 text-base font-medium">" Before joining the bootcamp, I've
          never written a line of code. I needed
          some structure from professionals
          who can help me learn programming
          step by step. I was encouraged to
          enroll by a former student of theirs
          who can only say wonderful things
          about the program. The entire
          curriculum and staff did not
          disappoint. Theft ere very hands-on
          and I never had to wait long for
          assistance. The agile team project, in
          particular, was outstanding. It took
          my learning to the next level in a way
          that no tutorial could ever have. In
          fact, I've otten referred to it during
          interviews as an a example of my
          developent experience,to certainly
          helped me land a job as a full-stack
          developer after receiving multiple
          offers, 100% recommend! "</p>
